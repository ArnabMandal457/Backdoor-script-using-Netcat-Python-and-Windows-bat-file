# PookiePrank: A Cute but Terrifying Cybersecurity Awareness Tool 🎀💀

> *“I seek not thy leave, nor bend my will to thine approval for the prank.  
> What must be done, I do — not by thy grace, but by mine own resolve.”*  
> — **Arnab, 2025**

## What Is This?

**PookiePrank** is a lightweight "educational" program designed to demonstrate the importance of digital awareness through *strategic chaos*.  
It's a prank tool wrapped in charm — **cute on the outside, spooky on the inside**.

- Uses `Netcat` for remote shell access (with full user control)
- Disguised behind a friendly-looking Python GUI
- Includes optional payloads like Rickrolling, shutdown timers, popups, etc.
- Perfect for ethical demos, cybersecurity training, and… *light mischief*.

---

## Features

- **Silent Netcat Backdoor:** Triggers a reverse shell silently via batch file.
- **User Distraction UI:** Friendly messages and fake interactions to lower suspicion.
- **Remote Payload Execution:** Once connected, send commands in real-time.
- **Prank Arsenal:** Shutdowns, message popups, browser hijacks, and more.
- **Educational Angle:** Reinforces the dangers of blind trust in random executables.

---

## Why?

Because **security through trauma** works.  
This tool is designed to:

- Raise awareness of how easily social engineering works.
- Show how reverse shells operate.
- Make friends laugh *and* cry.
- Be a conversation starter in any cybersecurity interview.

## Usage

1. Host the executable and `netcat` folder.
2. Send the masked download link using a shortened IP logger service.
3. Wait for the target to run the file.
4. Connect to the shell:
   ```bash
   nc64 -lvp 4444
5. Enjoy responsibly (or face karmic doom).

4. Always reveal the prank eventually.

5. Use only on friends who won't yeet you into oblivion.

## Legal Disclaimer

**This project is for educational and ethical use only.
The creator takes no responsibility for misuse or unforeseen Rickroll (or any) damage caused by the same.**

## Future Plans

1. Add GUI launcher with meme themes

2. Auto-cancel prank if user types a secret code

3. PookieSec Dashboard™ for multi-prank coordination

4. Add dancing ASCII Rick in the terminal



## One Last Thing...

> **IMPORTANT:** For this prank to work, **you and your target must be on the same network** (e.g., college Wi-Fi, LAN party, cursed hostel internet).  
> Netcat operates over **local IP addresses** unless you're routing through public ports with port forwarding — which we’re *not doing here* (because jail is not part of the prank).

So yeah — **same Wi-Fi = RickRoll access granted**.

Stay stealthy, stay sassy.
